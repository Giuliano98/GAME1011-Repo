# GAME1011-Repo
This is my Repo for Game 1011 (Advanced Programming) at George Brown College as a first-year student.

I divided my Repo  into 2 branches:
  - main: the main branch will store my lab project which will be presented as my homework.
  - week: the week branch will be my notes from exercises in each class.
